# Webcam Motion Detection (OpenCV)

This project implements a real-time motion detection system using a webcam and classical computer vision techniques.

The program continuously captures frames from a webcam, compares consecutive frames to detect motion, and displays live video output. This project focuses on understanding core computer vision concepts such as frame differencing, noise reduction, and real-time video processing.

## Features
- Live webcam video capture
- Continuous frame processing
- Motion detection foundation (frame differencing)
- Clean exit and resource handling

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## How It Works
1. Capture frames from the webcam
2. Process frames in real time
3. Detect changes between consecutive frames
4. Display live video output

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
